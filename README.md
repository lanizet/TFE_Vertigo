In this GitHub repository, you can find all the scritps used in the framework of our master thesis about : "Biomarker identification for vertigo through human connectome analysis".

The analysis is based on two kinds of data: structural (diffusion) and functional data from MRI.
For each type of data, a specific pipeline was followed. The scripts used in the structural pipeline can be found in the folder 'structural' while the ones used for the functional data can be found in the folder 'functional'.

Here below are described the pipelines followed for both types of data:

## Structural pipeline :
  * Preprocessing
  * Registration
  * Tractograms
  * Connectomes
  * Network measures from connectomes
  * Features table creation from connectomes
  * Prefiltering feature selection
  * Wrapped feature selection
  
## Functional pipeline :
  * Preprocessing
  * Registration
  * Connectomes
  * Network measures from connectomes
  * Features table creation from connectomes
  * Prefiltering feature selection
  * Wrapped feature selection
